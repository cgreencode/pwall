### pwall.org - a lightweight, open-source, universal paper wallet generator
# ![](img/wallet.png)
#### Description
Using third-party services to generate paper wallets should be avoided without proper code auditing by independent entities.  
Unnecessary codes and poorly written libraries are often used, creating a huge security risk for users.  
Some services advertise that their generator works offline, and thus its users are immune to private key theft.
However, there is still a possibility that an offline paper wallet generator creates keys deterministically without ever needing to communicate this information in any way.  
For this reason, I wouldn't trust any random websites offering offline paper wallet generators without proper investigation.  
pwall, on the other hand, contains no bloat but only the essentials.
Feel free to use it. https://pwall.org/
